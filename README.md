# geo_qt #
The repository consists of a toolkit for creating geo-data inspired artworks to accompany the AHRC funded [Digital Realism](http://digital-realism.net) project.

The geo_qt package is a collection of mapping tools for rendering large scale images and animations. It has been designed as a lightweight framework that can easily be extended to create interactive rendering tools. The GUI and the map interface are based on the Python PySide library. 

Typically a map would be generated by specifying the map layers and data sources in a config file, overriding the map layer class rendering, and extending the GUI controls to interactively style the map.
